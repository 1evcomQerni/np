## What is 'netcore'?
 
'Netcore' is a web server for web applications running on the web stack. It is a 16-bit device that can be used for many types of applications in projects ranging from simple measurement to complex circuits. This device connects to the PC via a serial port and communicates with Circuit Wizard using a protocol called Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) or the 2-wire Inter-Integrated Circuit (IÂ²C) bus.
 
'Netcore' allows you to use your circuits as web servers, which means that you can access them from any browser on any device. You can also use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create user interfaces for your circuits, as well as use web APIs to interact with other web services.
