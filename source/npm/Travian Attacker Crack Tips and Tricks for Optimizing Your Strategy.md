Travian is a popular browser-based strategy game that challenges you to build your own empire and compete with other players. One of the most important aspects of Travian is farming, which means raiding other villages for resources and troops. Farming can be tedious and time-consuming, especially if you have many villages and targets to manage.
  
That's why some players use Travian Attacker, a bot that can automate your farming and make your life easier. Travian Attacker can detect incoming attacks, send troops to farm or reinforce, queue up buildings and training, archive reports, coordinate attacks, and provide statistics and overviews of your account. It can also evade captchas and avoid detection by the game administrators.

- Choose your tribe wisely. Each tribe has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on your playing style and goals. Romans are good for building and expanding, Gauls are good for defending and raiding, Teutons are good for attacking and plundering, Egyptians are good for trading and farming, and Huns are good for speed and mobility. Think about what you want to achieve in the game and pick the tribe that suits you best.
- Plan your village layout. The placement of your buildings can affect your resource production, troop training, culture points, and defense. You should always build your resource fields as high as possible, since they are the backbone of your economy. You should also build your main building, barracks, stable, workshop, academy, smithy, rally point, and town hall close to each other, since they are essential for your military development. You should also consider building a wall, a treasury, a trade office, a granary, a warehouse, and a cranny to protect your resources and treasures.
- Raid oases and inactive players. Oases are neutral areas that contain resources and animals. You can raid them with your troops to get extra resources and experience points. Inactive players are those who have not logged in for a long time or have been banned by the game administrators. You can raid them with your troops to get easy resources and reduce competition. You can use tools like [Travian Attack Planner](https://travian.codelab.rs/planner) to plan your raids efficiently.
- Join or create an alliance. Travian is a community-based game and no one will be successful on their own. Get to know the alliances in your area and make a decision on who you want to join. If you manage to join a large alliance, other players might think twice about raiding you. You can also get support, advice, and coordination from your alliance members. If you create your own alliance, you can recruit other players who share your vision and goals. You can also form confederacies or non-aggression pacts with other alliances to expand your influence.
- Specialize your villages based on their tribe. If you play on a server with the keep tribe on conquer feature enabled, you can have villages of different tribes on your account. This allows you to use the benefits of each tribe without suffering too much from their downsides. For example, you can have a Roman village for building and expanding, a Gaul village for defending and raiding, a Teuton village for attacking and plundering, an Egyptian village for trading and farming, and a Hun village for speed and mobility. You can also equip your hero with items from different tribes to boost their performance.

These are just some of the tips and tricks that can help you improve your Travian skills. Of course, there is much more to learn and discover in this complex and fascinating game.
