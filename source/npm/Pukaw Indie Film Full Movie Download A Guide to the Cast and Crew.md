## The Plot of Pukaw
 
Pukaw follows the lives of three policemen who are involved in the anti-drug operations in Manila. They are Sgt. Benjie (Allen Dizon), a corrupt cop who extorts money from drug dealers; Sgt. Doming (Emilio Garcia), a veteran officer who is loyal to his duty; and Cpl. Gido (Felix Roco), a rookie cop who is idealistic and naive.
 
Their paths cross when they are assigned to raid a drug den where they encounter a notorious drug lord named Totoy (Nonie Buencamino). During the raid, Benjie shoots Totoy in cold blood and plants evidence on him. However, Totoy's wife Nena (Gina Alajar) witnesses the crime and vows to seek justice for her husband.
 
As Nena pursues her case against Benjie, she uncovers a web of corruption and violence that implicates not only Benjie but also Doming and Gido. She also faces threats and harassment from Benjie's cohorts who want to silence her. Meanwhile, Doming and Gido struggle with their own moral dilemmas as they witness Benjie's atrocities.
