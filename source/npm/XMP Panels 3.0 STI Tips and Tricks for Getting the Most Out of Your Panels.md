If you are wondering how XMP Panels 3.0 STI work, here is a simple explanation. The panels absorb the solar radiation and convert it into heat, which is then transferred to a fluid that circulates through the micro-channel heat exchanger. The fluid then delivers the heat to a storage tank, where it can be used for domestic hot water or space heating. Alternatively, the heat can be used to power an absorption chiller, which can provide cooling for your home or office.
 
XMP Panels 3.0 STI are not only efficient, but also reliable and safe. They have a high resistance to corrosion, freezing and overheating, thanks to their robust materials and components. They also have a low risk of leakage, as they use a closed-loop system that prevents any contact between the fluid and the air. Moreover, they have a long lifespan of up to 25 years, with minimal maintenance required.
 
XMP Panels 3.0 STI are not only suitable for residential buildings, but also for commercial and industrial applications. They can be used to provide hot water and heating for hotels, hospitals, schools, factories and more. They can also be used to provide cooling for data centers, supermarkets, warehouses and more. They can help you reduce your operating costs and increase your competitiveness in the market.
