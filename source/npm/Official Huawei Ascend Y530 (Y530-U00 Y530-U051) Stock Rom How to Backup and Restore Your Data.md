## What is Stock Firmware?
 
Stock firmware is the official software that comes pre-installed on your device by the manufacturer. It is also known as stock ROM or flash file. Stock firmware contains the operating system, kernel, drivers, apps, and settings of your device. It is usually customized and optimized for your specific device model and region.
 
Stock firmware is important because it provides the basic functionality and security of your device. It also allows you to receive official updates and patches from the manufacturer. Sometimes, you may need to flash or install stock firmware on your device if you encounter any software problems, such as bootloop, lagging, crashing, freezing, virus infection, or bricking. Flashing or installing stock firmware can also help you to upgrade or downgrade your firmware version, or restore your device to its factory settings.
