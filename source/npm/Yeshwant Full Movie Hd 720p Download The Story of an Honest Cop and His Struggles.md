## Yeshwant Movie Review
 
Yeshwant is a movie that showcases the struggle of an honest cop against the corrupt system. Nana Patekar plays the titular role of Yeshwant Lohar, a police inspector who does not compromise on his principles and values. He faces many challenges and enemies in his career and personal life, but he does not give up on his fight for justice.
 
The movie is a hard-hitting drama that does not shy away from showing the reality of the crime world and the police force. The dialogues are sharp and witty, and the action scenes are realistic and thrilling. The movie also has a strong female character in Ragini, played by Madhoo, who is Yeshwant's wife and an IAS officer. She supports her husband in his mission and also stands up to the villains who try to defame her.
 
The movie is well-directed by Anil Mattoo, who makes his debut with this film. He manages to keep the audience engaged with a tight script and a fast-paced narration. The music by Anand-Milind is decent, with the song "Ek Machhar" being the highlight. The movie also marks the last appearance of Shafi Inamdar, who plays a lawyer and Yeshwant's friend.
