## Step 1: Download and install Photodex ProShow Producer 4.52.3053
 
The first step is to download and install Photodex ProShow Producer 4.52.3053 on your computer. You can download it from the official website[^1^] or from other sources[^2^]. The file name is ProShow\_Producer\_4.52\_Setup.exe and the file size is 68.6 MB.
 
After downloading the file, double-click on it to run the setup wizard. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation process. You may need to restart your computer after the installation.
 
## Step 2: Download and replace three .dnt files
 
The second step is to download and replace three .dnt files in the ProShow installation directory. These files are all.dnt, if.dnt, and pshow.dnt. They are responsible for checking the registration key and connecting to the activation server. By replacing them with patched files, you can bypass the registration key requirement and avoid the "Activation Server is Unavailable" message.
 
You can download the three .dnt files from this link[^1^]. The file name is ProShow\_Patch.zip and the file size is 5 KB.
 
After downloading the file, unzip it to a folder of your choice. You should see three .dnt files inside.
 
Next, go to the ProShow installation directory on your computer. The default location is C:\Program Files (x86)\Photodex\Proshow Producer.
 
Before replacing the files, make sure to rename the original files to keep a backup of them. For example, rename all.dnt to all2.dnt, if.dnt to if2.dnt, and pshow.dnt to pshow2.dnt.
 
Then, copy the three .dnt files from the folder where you unzipped them and paste them into the ProShow installation directory. Overwrite the existing files if prompted.
 
## Step 3: Delete two .cfg and .phd files
 
The third step is to delete two .cfg and .phd files in the ProShow installation directory. These files are proshow.cfg and proshow.phd. They are responsible for storing some settings and data of the software. By deleting them, you can remove any traces of previous activations or evaluations and avoid the "Evaluation Copy" or "Use Illegally" banner.
 
To delete these files, go to the ProShow installation directory on your computer (C:\Program Files (x86)\Photodex\Proshow Producer) and look for proshow.cfg and proshow
