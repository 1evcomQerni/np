You might also lose some data or settings during the unlocking process. You should always backup your phone before unlocking it and follow the instructions carefully.
- You might break the law or violate the terms of service. Some countries or regions have laws or regulations that prohibit unlocking or require permission from the carrier or manufacturer. You should check the legal status of unlocking in your area before doing it. You should also read the terms of service of your carrier or manufacturer and make sure that you are not violating them by unlocking your phone.
