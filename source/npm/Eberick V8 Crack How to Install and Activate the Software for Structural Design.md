## Features and Benefits of Eberick V8
 
Eberick V8 has many features that make it a powerful and versatile tool for structural design. Some of them are:
 
- 3D modeling: You can create and edit the structural model in a 3D environment, with tools that allow you to simulate different scenarios and optimize the solution. You can also import and view the model with other BIM disciplines in IFC format, and detect and resolve clashes between elements.
- Analysis and dimensioning: You can perform the analysis of forces and displacements of the structure, as well as the dimensioning of the structural elements, according to the Brazilian standards and integrated with the modeling tools. You can also identify and correct errors and parameters that exceed the normative limits.
- Documentation: You can generate the executive details of the structural elements and other plans of the project with clarity and high quality. You can also customize the drawings according to your preferences. You can also generate a single document with the calculation report of the project, containing the reports related to the analyses, the obtaining of the efforts and the dimensioning of the elements.
- Quantification and budgeting: You can generate the summary of materials of the structure at any time of the project and perform the budget integrated with Alto Qi Visus, a software for budgeting and planning BIM. You can also use exclusive tools for structural optimization that allow you to analyze alternative solutions and evaluate which ones result in greater technical and economic efficiency.
