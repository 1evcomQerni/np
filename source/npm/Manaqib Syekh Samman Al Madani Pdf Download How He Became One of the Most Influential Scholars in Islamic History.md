## What is Sufism?
 
Sufism is the mystical dimension of Islam that focuses on the inner purification of the heart and the attainment of closeness to God. Sufis are Muslims who follow a path of spiritual discipline and ethical conduct that leads them to the realization of their true nature and their relationship with the Divine. Sufis believe that God is the ultimate reality and the source of all existence, and that everything in the universe is a manifestation of His names and attributes. Sufis seek to know God through love, devotion, and service to His creation.
  
Sufism has a rich history and diversity of expressions across different regions, cultures, and schools of thought. Sufis have contributed greatly to the development of Islamic civilization in various fields such as literature, art, science, philosophy, and social reform. Some of the most famous Sufis in history include Rumi, Ibn Arabi, Al-Ghazali, Rabia al-Adawiyya, Hafiz, Attar, and many others.
  
Sufism is not a sect or a denomination of Islam, but rather a way of life that can be practiced by any Muslim who follows the teachings of the Quran and the Sunnah (the example of the Prophet Muhammad). Sufism does not contradict or oppose the exoteric aspects of Islam such as the five pillars (testimony of faith, prayer, fasting, charity, and pilgrimage), but rather complements and enhances them by adding an esoteric dimension that enriches the soul and elevates the spirit.
  
## How to Learn Sufism?
 
One of the best ways to learn Sufism is to read the works of the Sufi masters and scholars who have explained the principles and practices of this path in a clear and comprehensive manner. Some of the recommended books for beginners are:

- [Purification of the Heart: Signs, Symptoms and Cures of the Spiritual Diseases of the Heart](https://www.amazon.com/Purification-Heart-Signs-Symptoms-Spiritual/dp/1929694156) by Hamza Yusuf
- [Al-Maqasid: Nawawi's Manual of Islam](https://www.amazon.com/Al-Maqasid-Nawawis-Manual-Islamic-Jurisprudence/dp/1590080164) by Nuh Ha Mim Keller
- [Secrets of Divine Love: A Spiritual Journey into the Heart of Islam](https://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Divine-Love-Journey-Heart/dp/1734231203) by A. Helwa
- [The Spiritual Teachings of Rumi](https://www.amazon.com/Spiritual-Teachings-Rumi/dp/1570623465) by Philip Dunn
- [The Book of Assistance](https://www.amazon.com/Spiritual-Teachings-Rumi/dp/1570623465) by Imam Al-Haddad

Another way to learn Sufism is to join a Sufi order or community that follows a specific lineage and method of spiritual training under the guidance of a qualified teacher or shaykh. There are many Sufi orders in the world today, each with its own history, teachings, practices, and rituals. Some of the well-known Sufi orders are:

- The Naqshbandiyya order, which traces its origin to Abu Bakr as-Siddiq (the first caliph) and emphasizes silent remembrance (dhikr) of God in the heart.
- The Qadiriyya order, which traces its origin to Syekh Abdul Qadir al-Jilani (the founder) and emphasizes generosity, service, and miracles.
- The Shadhiliyya order, which traces its origin to Syekh Abu al-Hasan al-Shadhili (the founder) and emphasizes love, beauty, and wisdom.
- The Chishtiyya order, which traces its origin to Syekh Moinuddin Chishti (the founder) and emphasizes music, poetry, and ecstasy.
- The Mevleviyya order, which traces its origin to Syekh Jalaluddin Rumi (the founder) and emphasizes whirling dance (sama) as a form of worship.
