# How to Get FineScale Modeler 25 Year Collection on DVD-ROM for Free
 
If you are a scale model enthusiast, you might be interested in getting the FineScale Modeler 25 Year Collection on DVD-ROM, which contains over 200 issues of the magazine from 1982 to 2007. This DVD-ROM is a valuable resource for model builders, as it contains thousands of articles, reviews, tips, tricks and ideas for scale modeling projects. However, the DVD-ROM is not cheap, as it costs $99.95 on the official website[^1^]. So, how can you get it for free?
 
One way is to look for a torrent file that contains the DVD-ROM image. A torrent file is a small file that contains information about a larger file that can be downloaded from multiple sources using a peer-to-peer network. Torrent files are often used to share copyrighted material illegally, so you should be careful when using them. You might encounter viruses, malware, fake files or legal issues if you download torrents without proper precautions.
